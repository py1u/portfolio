          Hi! My name is Peter and I currently study at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Data Science & Business.
          <br><br>
          Growing up in SoCal, I had a passion for science and technology wanting to transform ideas into solutions that changed people's lives. In high school, I enjoyed biology and computer science and wanted to pursue a career where I could leverage both. I ended up studying data science because it allowed me to explore many different fields of science including biology and CS, and find my joy in blending creativity, innovation, and problem-solving.
          <br><br>
          My interest in design came from my belief that creating human connection through impactful changes aims to better an aspect of someone's life whether it's minimal or big. Creating a product that would bring joy to people while proving its feasibility, adaptability, and accessibility was my goal. This was where I decided to pursue business and learn how to build a product that would reach the right audience.
          <br><br>
          When I'm not coding or designing, I am listening to k-pop, reading books, skateboarding to find boba shops and local cafes, and trying my best to navigate life.
          <br><br>
          You can catch me studying at the library, marketing for Bearhack, designing websites for campus organizations through Design At UCR, and in search of the next best boba place!
